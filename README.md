Throughout this project, I delved into analyzing the housing market in the USA. 🏠🔍

1. Data Collection I initiated the process by thoroughly gathering information, focusing on price variations among states. 📊🗺️

2. Price Analysis Using a subquery, I computed average home prices and pinpointed listings below that threshold. 💵🔍

3. Price Trends I observed a fascinating trend - prices for apartments with 1-10 bathrooms or bedrooms showed a tendency to rise, but after surpassing that number, the pricing dynamics became more variable. 📈🔄

4. State Comparisons Leveraging join operations, I meticulously compared prices in different states, unveiling unique price differentials. 🤝🌐

5. Database Optimization I employed the alter table - drop column operation, eliminating redundant columns and focusing on key information, positively impacting data clarity. 🧹💻

This analysis not only shed light on the intricacies of the real estate market in the USA but also yielded valuable insights into pricing dynamics. 🚀💼
